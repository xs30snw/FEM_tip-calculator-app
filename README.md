## My process

### What I learned

Become better accustomed with planning layout of different buttons and fields. This task was a good introduction for JS logic, and manipulating site elements via scripts.

The app can be further improved by controlling the information at inputs. As it is right now, a user can enter characters instead of numbers, or they can give very large numbers, which cause layout to behave in unpredictable ways.
